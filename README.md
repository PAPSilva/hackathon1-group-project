# Pay Another Way
Hackathon July 2018

A demon boy fights its way through a horde of enemies hoping we can rescue his girlfriend. Out of money to pay the ransom, there is no other path but this one. If only he could pay it in another way!

This is a 2D third person shooter.

## Scope

This project was developed in 24h from idea to deployment. We also had to prepare a presentation of the game within that timeframe. The topic had to be related to a random song, given to us at the beginning of the hackaton. Our luck gave us 'Ouvi dizer - Ornatos Violeta' (it is a great portuguese song, you should hear it!)  

We tried to make the game in an isometric view and we invested a lot of our time trying to implement it. The current top view was our fallback plan.

The game was implemented using libGDX and the map was made using Tiled.

## Features

* Anime graphics
* Collision
* Modular design

## How to play

Use the directional arrows to move around and SPACE to shoot.

Note: as it stands, there are no win nor lose conditions and enemies walk randomly, making it difficult to find them after a certain time.

## Further development

The game is incomplete. It lacks the following features:
* Isometric view.
* Map boundaries.
* Win condition - Get to the girl or kill all the bad guys.
* Lose condition - Die if touched or shot by an enemy.
* Enemy collision with map.
* Enemy should return fire.
* Enemy AI - Enemies should approach and fire if player is within a certain range.
* Diferent types of enemies.
* Different weapons.
* Items and powerups.
* Menus - instructons and gameover.
